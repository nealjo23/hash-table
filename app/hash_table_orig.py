# This hash-tables sample code from Blackboard uses double hashing.
# Double hashing is to resolve collisions - i.e. when the hashed key index is already filled.
# In this case, the 2nd hash value is an offset to add to the first index to look for an empty slot.
# If the new slot is filled, the offset is added again and again until an empty slot is found.
# At the end of the array, modulo division with the array size sets the index back to the start of the array.
#
# The problem with this example is that the array size is not a prime number.  This means it is possible for
# the 2nd hash value and the array size to have a common divisor > 1.  If this occurs when the hash table is not empty,
# the search for an empty slot can get into an infinite loop of looking at the same slots over and over without
# checking the empty slots.
# When table size is a prime, the 2nd hash value and the table size will have a greatest common divisor of 1, ensuring
# all slots are checked when hopping around searching for an empty slot.

# While researching this topic, I found that the algorithm in this code is __identical__ to the code
# shown on the following link:
#  https://www.topcoder.com/thrive/articles/double-hashing

# Other issues with this code are described within the code below.
